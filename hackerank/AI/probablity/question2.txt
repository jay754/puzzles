Question:

For a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) dice,
find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and their sum is 6.

Answer:

Total outputs is 36
(2,4) , (4,2), (1,5), (5,1) -> outcomes -> there is also (3,3) and (3,3) -> but these aren't different hence not counted

hence it is the four outcomes above divided the possible outputs

4/36 -> 1/9
